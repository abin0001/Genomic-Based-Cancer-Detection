# Genomic-Based-Cancer-Detection
Cancer is a multifaceted illness with a variety of genetic changes that impact its initiation, progression, and outcome of treatment Deep learning is applied to nearly every facet of the healthcare sector, including medication discovery, clinical research, early disease detection, and virtual assistance. One of the key areas where data-driven approaches are presently being used is the prediction of complicated diseases as soon as feasible. Leveraging advancements in deep learning techniques helps to suggests a unique method for genomically-based cancer prediction. To build a predictive model, this work makes use of extensive genomic data. Disease prediction is one of the difficult role and demands a large effort because they root from inherited genetic disorders. The developed predictive model demonstrates robust performance in correctly categorizing and predicting cancer risk. With the help of DNA sequence patterns, the created prediction model performs reliably well in identifying and forecasting cancer susceptibility. This approach has implications for aiding early-stage cancer diagnosis. A possible path towards precision oncology is the use of DNA sequence patterns for cancer prediction, which emphasizes how genetic data might improve patient outcomes and diagnostic precision.
